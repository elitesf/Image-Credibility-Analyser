# IMAGE CREDIBILITY ANALYSER

It is a methodology and program to assist a person to identify if an image and associated title are trustworthy. The fundamentals of our approach are based on corroboration of news, i.e, the image must be present in credible news websites with description similar to that of the associated title for the image and description to be reliable. If not, we recommend that the user perform a human verification procedure.
